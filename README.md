# SMAI Assignments

This repository contains basic implementations of some common algorithms I had to implement for the SMAI, Fall'21 course at IIIT-H.

* **01 Clustering**:  Implementation of K-Means and some experiments with different initialization techniques, distance metrics and finding optimal number of clusters.


* **02 CNN**: Training a basic image classifier using a CNN in pytorch.

* **03 Decision Trees**: Using decision trees on the WBC dataset and experimenting with basic parameters like number of layers, measure used for purity etc. Also, contains implementation of Random Forest Algorithm.

* **04 RNN**: Basic sentiment classification task using RNN and LSTMs and performance comparison between the two.

* **05 SVM**: SVM implementation using CVXPY

* **06 KNN, logistic regression etc**: Basic implementation of KNN and logistic regression
